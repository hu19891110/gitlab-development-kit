# GitLab Development Kit

The GDK runs a GitLab development environment isolated in a directory.
This environment contains GitLab CE, CI and Runner.
This project uses Foreman to run dedicated Postgres and Redis processes for
GitLab development. All data is stored inside the gitlab-development-kit
directory. All connections to supporting services go through Unix domain
sockets to avoid port conflicts.

## Design goals

- Get the user started, do not try to take care of everything
- Run everything as your 'desktop' user on your development machine
- GitLab Development Kit itself does not run `sudo` commands
- It is OK to leave some things to the user (e.g. installing Ruby)

## Installation

The preferred way to use GitLab Development Kit is to install Ruby and dependencies on your 'native' OS.
We strongly recommend the native install since it is much faster than a virtualized one.
If you want to use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) instead/need to do development from Windows 
please see [the instructions for our (experimental) Vagrantfile](#vagrant).

### Install dependencies

#### Prerequisites for all platforms

If you do not have the dependencies below you will experience strange errors during installation.

1. A non-root unix user, this can be your normal user but **DO NOT** run the installation as a root user
1. Ruby 2.1.6 installed with a ruby version manager (RVM, ruby-build, rbenv, chruby, etc.), **DO NOT** use the system Ruby
1. bundler, which you can install with `gem install bundler`

```
PhantomJS - You will want to download the required version of PhantomJS and place the binary on the path.

Git 1.7.1-3 is the latest git binary for CentOS 6.5 and gitlab.  Spinach tests will fail due to a higher version requirement by gitlab.
You can follow the instructions found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-recipes/tree/master/install/centos#add-puias-computational-repository)
to install a newer binary version of git.

### Clone GitLab Development Kit repository

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit.git
cd gitlab-development-kit
```

### Install the repositories and gems

The `Makefile` will clone the repositories, install the Gem bundles and set up
basic configuration files. Pick one:

```
# Clone the official repositories of gitlab and gitlab-shell
make
```

Alternatively, you can clone straight from your forked repositories or GitLab EE.

```
# Clone your own forked repositories
make gitlab_repo=git@gitlab.com:example/gitlab-ce.git gitlab_shell_repo=git@gitlab.com:example/gitlab-shell.git \
  gitlab_ci_repo=git@gitlab.com:example/gitlab-ci.git gitlab_runner_repo=git@gitlab.com:example/gitlab-ci-runner.git
```

### Post-installation

Start Redis and PostgreSQL by running the command below in the root of the project:

    bundle exec foreman start

Keep the above command running and seed the main GitLab database from a new terminal session:

    cd gitlab && bundle exec rake db:create dev:setup

Finally, start the main GitLab rails application in the gitlab subdirectory of the project:

    bundle exec foreman start

Now you can go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
The development login credentials are `root` and `5iveL!fe`

If you want to work on GitLab CI, first seed the GitLab CI database:

    cd gitlab-ci && bundle exec rake db:create db:setup

To start the GitLab CI rails application:

    bundle exec foreman start

Setup the GitLab Runner:

    go-workspace/bin/gitlab-ci-multi-runner -u http://localhost:9000 

Start the GitLab Runner:

    go-workspace/bin/gitlab-ci-multi-runner run

To enable the OpenLDAP server, see the OpenLDAP instructions in this readme.

END Post-installation

Please do not delete the 'END Post-installation' line above. It is used to
print the post-installation message from the `Makefile`.

### Vagrant
[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) is a tool for setting up identical development
environments including all dependencies regardless of the host platform you are using. 
Vagrant will default to using [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org), but it has 
many plugins for different environments.

Vagrant allows you to develop GitLab without affecting your host machine (but we 
recommend developing GitLab on metal if you can).
Vagrant can be very slow since the files are synced between the host OS and GitLab 
(testing) accesses a lot of files.
You can improve the speed by keeping all the files on the guest OS but in that case you 
should take care to not lose the files if you destroy or update the VM.

#### Install
1. [Disable Hyper-V](http://superuser.com/a/642027/143551) (Windows users) then enable virtualization technology via the BIOS.
2. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) & [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com).
3. Run `vagrant up` in this directory (from an elevated command prompt if on Windows)
  a. Vagrant will download an OS image, bring it up, and install all the prerequisites.
4. Run `vagrant ssh` to SSH into the box.
5. Run `cd ~/gitlab-development-kit/` and continue setup at 
*[Install the repositories and gems](#install-the-repositories-and-gems)* above.

#### Development details
* Open development environment by running `vagrant up` & `vagrant ssh` (from an elevated command prompt if on Windows).
* Follow the general [development guidelines](#development) but running the commands in the `vagrant ssh` session.
* Files in the `gitlab`, `gitlab-shell`, `gitlab-ci`, and `gitlab-runner` folders will be synced between the host OS & guest OS so can be edited on either the host (under this folder) or guest OS (under `~/gitlab-development-kit/`).

#### Exit
* When you want to shutdown Vagrant run `exit` from the guest OS and then `vagrant halt`
from the host OS.

#### Troubleshooting

* On some setups the shared folder will have the wrong user. This is detected
by the Vagrantfile and you should `sudo su - build` to switch to the correct user
in that case.
* If you get a "Timed out while waiting for the machine to boot" message you likely
forgot to [disable Hyper-V](http://superuser.com/a/642027/143551) or enable virtualization technology via the BIOS.
* If you have continious problems starting Vagrant you can uncomment `vb.gui = true` 
to view any error messages.
* If you have problems running `support/edit-gitlab.yml` (bash script despite file extension)
 see http://stackoverflow.com/a/5514351/1233435.
* If you have errors with symlinks or Ruby during initialization make sure you ran `vagrant up` from an elevated command prompt (Windows users). 

## Development

When doing development, you will need one shell session (terminal window)
running Postgres and Redis, and one or more other sessions to work on GitLab
itself.

### Example

First start Postgres and Redis.

```
# terminal window 1
# current directory: gitlab-development-kit
bundle exec foreman start
```

Next, start a Rails development server.

```
# terminal window 2
# current directory: gitlab-development-kit/gitlab
bundle exec foreman start
```

Now you can go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
The development login credentials are `root` and `5iveL!fe`

### Running the tests

In order to run the test you can use the following commands:
- `rake spinach` to run the spinach suite
- `rake spec` to run the rspec suite
- `rake jasmine:ci` to run the jasmine test suite
- `rake gitlab:test` to run all the tests

Note: You can't run `rspec .` since this will try to run all the `_spec.rb`
files it can find, also the ones in `/tmp`

To run a single test file you can use:

- `bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/commit_controller_spec.rb` for a rspec test
- `bundle exec spinach features/project/issues/milestones.feature` for a spinach test

## Update gitlab and gitlab-shell repositories

When working on a new feature, always check that your `gitlab` repository is up
to date with the upstream master branch.

In order to fetch the latest code, first make sure that `foreman` for
postgres is runnning (needed for db migration) and then run:

```
make update
```

This will update both `gitlab`, `gitlab-ci` and `gitlab-shell` and run any possible migrations.
You can also update them separately by running `make gitlab-update` `make gitlab-ci-update` and
`make gitlab-shell-update` respectively.

## OpenLDAP

To run the OpenLDAP installation included in the GitLab development kit do the following:

```
vim Procfile # remove the comment on the OpenLDAP line
cd gitlab-openldap
make # will setup the databases
```

in the gitlab repository edit config/gitlab.yml;

```yaml
ldap:
  enabled: true
  servers:
    main:
      label: LDAP
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 3890
      uid: 'uid'
      method: 'plain' # "tls" or "ssl" or "plain"
      base: 'dc=example,dc=com'
      user_filter: ''
      group_base: 'ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com'
      admin_group: ''
    # Alternative server, multiple LDAP servers only work with GitLab-EE
    # alt:
    #   label: LDAP-alt
    #   host: 127.0.0.1
    #   port: 3890
    #   uid: 'uid'
    #   method: 'plain' # "tls" or "ssl" or "plain"
    #   base: 'dc=example-alt,dc=com'
    #   user_filter: ''
    #   group_base: 'ou=groups,dc=example-alt,dc=com'
    #   admin_group: ''
```

The second database is optional, and will only work with Gitlab-EE.

## Troubleshooting

### Rails cannot connect to Postgres

- Check if foreman is running in the gitlab-development-kit directory.
- Check for custom Postgres connection settings defined via the environment; we
  assume none such variables are set. Look for them with `set | grep '^PG'`.

### 'LoadError: dlopen' when starting Ruby apps

This can happen when you try to load a Ruby gem with native extensions that
were linked against a system library that is no longer there. A typical culprit
is Homebrew on OS X, which encourages frequent updates (`brew update && brew
upgrade`) which may break binary compatibility.

```
bundle exec rake db:create gitlab:setup
rake aborted!
LoadError: dlopen(/Users/janedoe/.rbenv/versions/2.1.2/lib/ruby/gems/2.1.0/extensions/x86_64-darwin-13/2.1.0-static/charlock_holmes-0.6.9.4/charlock_holmes/charlock_holmes.bundle, 9): Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/libicui18n.52.1.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/janedoe/.rbenv/versions/2.1.2/lib/ruby/gems/2.1.0/extensions/x86_64-darwin-13/2.1.0-static/charlock_holmes-0.6.9.4/charlock_holmes/charlock_holmes.bundle
  Reason: image not found - /Users/janedoe/.rbenv/versions/2.1.2/lib/ruby/gems/2.1.0/extensions/x86_64-darwin-13/2.1.0-static/charlock_holmes-0.6.9.4/charlock_holmes/charlock_holmes.bundle
/Users/janedoe/gitlab-development-kit/gitlab/config/application.rb:6:in `<top (required)>'
/Users/janedoe/gitlab-development-kit/gitlab/Rakefile:5:in `require'
/Users/janedoe/gitlab-development-kit/gitlab/Rakefile:5:in `<top (required)>'
(See full trace by running task with --trace)
```

In the above example, you see that the charlock_holmes gem fails to load
`libicui18n.52.1.dylib`. You can try fixing this by re-installing
charlock_holmes:

```
# in /Users/janedoe/gitlab-development-kit
gem uninstall charlock_holmes
bundle install # should reinstall charlock_holmes
```
